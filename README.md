   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python generate.py [PATH/TO/CODE] [OUTPUT_FILENAME]
```

### Examples

**Scan a JavaScript project:**
```bash
python generate.py ./my-js-project javascript-security-report.pdf
```

**Scan a Python project:**
```bash
python generate.py ./my-python-app python-vulnerabilities.pdf
```

**Scan a specific file:**
```bash
python generate.py ./src/main.py single-file-report.pdf
```

### Output

The tool generates a PDF report containing:
- **Executive Summary**: Overview of findings
- **High Severity Vulnerabilities**: Critical security issues (red-coded)
- **Medium Severity Vulnerabilities**: Important security issues (yellow-coded)
- **Low Severity Vulnerabilities**: Minor security issues (green-coded)

Each vulnerability includes:
- Category/Type
- Description
- Severity Level
- Reference information
- Affected code lines

## Sample Reports

Check the `Sample Report/` directory for example PDF outputs:
- `javascript.pdf` - Sample JavaScript security report
- `python.pdf` - Sample Python security report

## Sample Vulnerabilities

The `Sample Vulnerability/` directory contains example vulnerable code files for testing:
- `javascript.js` - JavaScript vulnerabilities
- `vuln.js` - Additional JavaScript examples
- `vuln.py` - Python vulnerabilities

## Dependencies

- **rich**: For progress indicators and enhanced terminal output
- **fpdf**: For PDF generation and formatting
- **semgrep**: For static code analysis (external dependency)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"semgrep: command not found"**
- Ensure Semgrep CLI is properly installed and in your PATH
- Try reinstalling Semgrep CLI following the official documentation
